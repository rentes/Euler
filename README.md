# Euler

This is my set of solutions for [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler") problems.

Any particular solution for a given problem is written in Python 3 (and also conforming to [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ "PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code")). These solutions are not supposed to be perfect in terms of performance. Of course, I will be updating them to achieve better algorithmic performance, but the primary goal is to have fun solving mathematical problems. Any suggestions/improvements, please fork this repository and/or contact me.

Have fun!
