This is my set of solutions for Project Euler problems.

Please see http://projecteuler.net/ for more info.

Any particular solution for a given problem is written in Python.

These solutions are NOT supposed to be PERFECT in terms of performance. Of course, I will be updating them to achieve better algorithmic performance, but the primary goal is to have FUN and to learn how to program in Python.

Any suggestions/improvements, please fork this repository and/or contact me :)

Have fun!
